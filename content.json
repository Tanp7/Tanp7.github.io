From my perspective, it is motivation and methods that prove to be more crucial than the study itself. 第二段：引出原因分析的总体句+2~3个具体原因分析 Quite a few factors, as a matter of fact, could account for opinion.

The more efficiently you study, the greater success you will achieve. 第三段：总结+两个措施+喊口号 In a word, motivation and methods play a vital role in the study of youngsters.

Only in such ways of thinking can our work be done rapidly and comfortably. 题2![image-20211214160741442](/Users/pz/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20211214160741442.png) 范文：There is no doubt that the issue about community responsibility has caused wide public attention recently.

In addition, community responsibility can improve efficiency in the fast-paced modern society where time is money and efficiency holds the key to success. As a saying goes,”united, we stand; divided, we fall”. So great importance should be attached to the cultivation of the sense of community responsibility and we will eventually benefit from it. From what has been mentioned above, we can safely draw the conclusion that sense of community responsibility is a kind of good personal quality, which deserves our attention. So it is worth of our attention under modern conditions. Only in this way can we have a harmonious society. 总结开头引出中心+个人观点 正文引出原因分析总体句+2～3个具体原因分析 无话可说？ 分类论证 对于个人有什么影响 For individuals 对于集体有什么影响 For the collective 举例论证 结尾 Only by taking certain steps can people make full use of … So shouldn’t human being pay much attention to the meaningful saying/problem?
